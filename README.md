# NFnetFU (Neuro Fuzzy Network Fusion)

NFnetFU (Neuro Fuzzy network Fusion) is a modularised integrative pipeline for microbiome data analysis and diseases specific prioritisation for targeted research which addresses problems surrounding collinearity, sparsity and effect size in data.

## Results :

This section comprises of 4 folders: NFnetFU figures, Results D1, Results D2 and Results D3.

### NFnetFU figures :
All the figures discussed in the manuscript.

### Results D1 :
All files (plots and csv) generated by NFnetFU during the analysis of dataset 1.

### Results D2 :
All files (plots and csv) generated by NFnetFU during the analysis of dataset 2.

### Results D3 :
All files (plots and csv) generated by NFnetFU during the analysis of dataset 3.

## Code :

This section has all the .R files required for the analysis along with a Rmarkdown file demonstrating how to implement them. Dataset 2 and 3 take a long time to compile module 1 results. Please dowload the MicrobiomeAnalyst R package from https://github.com/xia-lab/MicrobiomeAnalystR before running the code. The code is modularised and outputs results at every stage.

## Data :

This section has all the microbiome/OTU abundance matrices, taxanomical files and labels for all the three datasets used for the analysis.
